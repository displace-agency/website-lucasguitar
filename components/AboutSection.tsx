              Hi, I'm Lucas — a guitar teacher based in Berlin with over 8 years of experience working with students of all ages. I started playing guitar when I was young, fell in love with jazz and improvisation, and eventually turned my passion into a career helping others discover theirs.
            </p>
            <p>
              Whether your child is picking up a guitar for the first time or you're an adult looking to finally learn that song you've always loved, I create lessons around what excites you. No rigid textbooks. No boring exercises. Just real music, real progress, and a lot of fun along the way.
            </p>
